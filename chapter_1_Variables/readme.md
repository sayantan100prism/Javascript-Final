**What is the difference betwen "==" and "==="?** ex4.js

-> "==" : comparison operator which compares only value but doesnot compare type.
-> "===" : comparison operator which compares both value and type.

**Can we insert value inside an array whose type declearation is "const"?** ex5.js

-> yes we can.We can change the elements of a constant array but we cannot change the array itself.

**what is the difference between "null" and "undefined"?**

->They both represent empty value but the difference is:
        - When you define a variable  but do not assign a value to it, it automatically puts
        a placeholder which is undefined. i.e automatically done by javascript
        - But incase of null we put this, when we want to clean a assigned value. There we put null.

        - typeof(undefined) => undefined
        - typepf(null) => object
