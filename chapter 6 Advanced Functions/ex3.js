//Calculate factorial

/*The factorial of a natural number is a number multiplied by "number minus one", 
then by "number minus two", and so on till 1. The factorial of n is denoted as n!

We can write a definition of factorial like this:*/

//n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ...*1
//Values of factorials for different n:
/*
1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

The task is to write a function factorial(n) that calculates n! using recursive calls.
P.S. Hint: n! can be written as n * (n-1)! For instance: 3! = 3*2! = 3*2*1! = 6

*/
function factorial(n){
    if(n == 1){
        return n;
    
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);

}
console.log(factorial(5));
